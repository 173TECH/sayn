# Tutorial Part 1: Getting Started With SAYN

This tutorial navigates you through your first SAYN run and explains the core components of a SAYN project. It uses the example project created by `sayn init`. It assumes SAYN is setup as described in the
[installation section](../installation.md).

## Your First SAYN Run

To get started, open a terminal, activate your virtual environment (`source sayn_venv/bin/activate`) and run the following:

```bash
sayn init sayn_tutorial
cd sayn_tutorial
sayn run
```

This will create a new project with the contents of this tutorial and execute it.

You have made your first SAYN run! This executed several tasks that created SQL data models (several tables and one view) in the SQLite database `dev.db`. You can use
[DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/){target="\_blank"} in order to view the content of the database. These data models model battles from various tournaments and are similar to transformation processes you would run in-warehouse for analytics purposes.

Now that you have made your first SAYN run, let's cover what happens in the background.

## Project Overview

The `sayn_tutorial` folder has the following structure:

```
tutorial
├── project.yaml
├── settings.yaml
├── python
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── load_data.py
├── sql
│   ├── dim_arenas.sql
│   ├── dim_fighters.sql
│   ├── dim_tournaments.sql
│   ├── f_battles.sql
│   ├── f_fighter_results.sql
│   └── f_rankings.sql
├── compile
├── logs
├── .gitignore
├── readme.md
└── requirements.txt
```

The main files are:

* `project.yaml`: defines the SAYN project and the task groups. It is **shared across all collaborators**.
* `settings.yaml`: defines the individual user's settings. It is **unique for each collaborator and should never be pushed to git** as it contains credentials.
* `python`: folder where scripts for `python` tasks are stored.
* `sql`: folder where SQL files for `sql` and `autosql` tasks are stored.
* `logs`: folder where SAYN logs are written.
* `compile`: folder where compiled SQL queries before execution.

## Setting Up Your Project

Now let's see how the tutorial project would be created from scratch.

### Step 1: Define The Project In `project.yaml`

The `project.yaml` file is at the root level of your directory and contains:

!!! example "project.yaml"
    ```yaml
    required_credentials:
      - warehouse

    default_db: warehouse

    groups:
      models:
        type: autosql
        file_name: "*.sql"
        materialisation: table
        destination:
          table: "{{ task.name }}"

      logs:
        type: python
        module: load_data
    ```

The following is defined:

* `required_credentials`: the list of credentials used by the project. In this case we have a single credential called `warehouse`. The connection details will be defined in `settings.yaml`.
* `default_db`: the database used by sql and autosql tasks. Since we only have 1 credential, this field could be skipped.
* `groups`: these define the core task groups of the project. The project only has one task group which defines the `models` task group. More details on what groups do in the next section of the tutorial.

### Step 2: Define Your Individual Settings

Your individual settings are defined by the `settings.yaml` file which is stored at the root level of your directory. It contains:

!!! example "settings.yaml"
    ```yaml
    profiles:
      dev:
        credentials:
          warehouse: dev_db

    default_profile: dev

    credentials:
      dev_db:
        type: sqlite
        database: dev.db
    ```

The following is defined:

* `profiles`: the definion of profiles for the project. A profile defines the connection between credentials in the `project.yaml` file and your own credentials.
* `default_profile`: the profile used by default at execution time. This can be overriden if necessary via `-p` flag of the run command.
* `credentials`: here we define the credentials necessary to run the project. We simply define our `warehouse` credential which is currently a SQLite database.

## What Next?

You now know the core components and have made your first SAYN run, congratulations! In the [next section of the tutorial](tutorial_part2.md), we go through how to use SAYN for data modelling.

Enjoy SAYN :)
